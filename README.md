This is still a research project, not a final product yet.

While the new code is getting more and more stable, I don't feel it is ready for general
consumption yet and I also need to keep the flexibility of being able to change it at will
(which would get more difficult if we partially landed this as part of some pull request)
for at least another week or two until the code has matured a bit more.
